# Lightning network implementation

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
A bounty is possible depending on the circumstances. If possible, this needs to be finalized before any promises are made and before work commences.

### Is this being worked on?
No

### Specifics
Although DigiByte can scale on-chain incredibly well, there are certain things that simply don't need to be store on-chain in perpituity. For example there is very little sense in someones coffee purchase remaining stored on-chain for future generations to be able to verify and validate.

Despite 2nd-layer solutions such as Lightning not being the primary way to scale DigiByte, there is still a valid place for off-chain transactions such as Lightning network. This bounty would be for an implementation of the Lightning network so that $DGB can be transacted off-chain and also interact with the likes of BTC across it.
