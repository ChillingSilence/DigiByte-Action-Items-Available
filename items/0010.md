### Submitted by

### Bounty details
There is currently no bounty available for this

### Is this being worked on?
Not yet

### Specifics
We have a UI redesign mock-up that is in keeping with the Android & iOS theme styles. This needs implementing in to the Core Wallet as the QT GUI.

This will likely require someone who is familiar with the QT CSS. We also have had reservations about including an DGB / Fiat pricing graph in it but otherwise would like to see the UI as close to the design as possible.

The UI designs include both a light / dark-mode. If one had to be prioritized ideally we would like to see the darker UI given it's alignment with mobile.
