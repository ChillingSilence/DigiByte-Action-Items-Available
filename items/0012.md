No

## Specifics

One of the challenges of getting developers started with DigiByte development has been the complexities of setting up a local development environment.  This project would implement a containerized DigiByte node configurable to run against the testnet or production network from a developer's local machine.

### Docker Container

One of the most difficult aspects of developing for DigiByte is the broad set of skills an aspiring developer requires to get started building their project.  A developer needs to know much more than the domain specifics of the DigiByte blockchain but  UTXO blockchains generally. In addition the developer must be knowledgable and comfortable with the fundamentals of TCP/IP; RPC calls; C++ develoment and so much more.  Perhaps the most challenging task is understanding how to provision, configure and deploy a full DigiByte testnet node to use as a development target.

This requirement seeks to construct a fully configured Docker container that contains a full DigiByte node connected to the test network that can be stood up and torn down by a developer with a simple terminal command: 'docker start [options] digibyte'

With this simple command a developer with limited utxo blockchain development experience can stand up a clean DigiByte development target to work against within minutes. The container will contain the following zero configuration components:

#### DigiByte Full Node

#### DigiAssets Server

#### Command Line Interface
