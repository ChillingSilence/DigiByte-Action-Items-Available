## Specifics

One of the challenges of getting developers started with DigiByte development has been the complexities of setting up a local development environment.  This project would implement a containerized DigiByte node configurable to run against the testnet or production network from a developer's local machine.

This item is for a docker or equivalent container that will include DigiByte Core 7.17.2. We ideally want variables set for things such as the download path so it can be easily updated later when 8.19.x is released.

It will launch the DigiByte Core wallet in testnet mode, and potentially whitelist RFC1918 IP ranges by default. As this is not for production, merely testing with zero-value testnet DigiByte's, it shouldn't be a security issue.

Once spun up, ideally it will notify the user in some manner of the local containers IP address, and show the synchronization progress in some form.

We then want it to optionally (If requested by the user) download the Insight Explorer (https://www.dgbwiki.com/index.php?title=Running_your_own_Insight_explorer), and utilize this in a testnet mode with the local Core Testnet wallet, allowing users to take advantage of the API calls that Insight offers (https://github.com/digibyte-core/insight-api/)

Finally, it should also show on-screen to the user it is going to run some additional commands (getnewaddress + generatetoaddress), perhaps this could take place after the Core installation but prior to the Insight installtaion, this will allow the user to then have some testnet funds and subsequently see them on the blockchain explorer.
