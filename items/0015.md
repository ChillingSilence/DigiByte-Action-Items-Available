# Swift SDK

## Submitted by

@gto90

## Bounty details

TBD

## Is this being worked on

No

## Specifics

The popularity of the Apple OSX, iOS, iPAD OS and tvOS platforms makes it a prime candidate to have a first class Swift SDK that can be used to integrate support for DigiByte and DigiAssets into any modern Apple application.  This SDK should be robustly documented so that code completion is fully supported in the XCode environment.
