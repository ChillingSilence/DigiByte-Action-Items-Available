# DigiAssets search in DigiExplorer

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
There is currently no bounty available for this

### Is this being worked on?
No

### Specifics
Initial DigiAssets support has been added to the Insight server DigiExplorer (DigiExplorer.info), however the search function does not currently support DigiAssets. Ideally people would be able to search at the top for an AssetID and have it take them to it.

For example, searching for "La2pepqc6PvxvPCV9BiUnq3VQQWeHpYHGhmRaG" would take them to:
https://explorer-1.us.digibyteservers.io/asset/La2pepqc6PvxvPCV9BiUnq3VQQWeHpYHGhmRaG/2206a6a2b6796281d6f1776854c37796a4fe26ec9a018f88180833a5af0c0a09/2

Bonus points if the history in the Assets page gets fixed too:
https://digiexplorer.info/assets

Right now the back / forth buttons don't actually do anything there
