# Mobile app DigiAsset management

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
There is currently no bounty available for this

### Is this being worked on?
No

### Specifics
At present all DigiAssets are put in to a drawer with no ability to further manage them.

Ideally users should be able to search through their Assets, either by AssetID or Name.

The ability to sort based on Asset Creation date, Date Received, Name, Amount etc would be preferable.
