### Is this being worked on?
Not yet

### Specifics
When you add a "Memo" to a DigiByte transaction it's not stored anywhere other than the local device

We should optionally allow users to store the Memo in the OP_RETURN (Warning them this will be 100% public), and also noting that this will increase the tx-fee for the transaction (More data to store, naturally)

This will likely need work done both in the Android / iOS layer, as well as [SPV Core](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/digibytewallet-core) to save the Memo on-chain.

This will need strings made for it so it can be translated, and potentially have a small "i" or similar in a circle next to the Memo (To give users details about it being publicly stored etc) with a slider for on / off (As with Dandelion).

Core will then need to check the OP_RETURN data for any incoming transactions as well and display them, there could be additional creative ways for us to display this to the user. It could be displayed in the transaction, but with an informational "i" on the main screen, or it could simply be displayed underneath the tx-data in the transaction list.
