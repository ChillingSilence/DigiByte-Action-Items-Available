# New DigiByte related videos for the website

### Submitted by
@makyurt

### Bounty details
No, but since the videos will be served on the main https://digibyte.io website, they will reach large audience. Designers can take the benefits of the traffic through their YouTube channel.

### Is this being worked on?
No

### Specifics
We need to update some of the current videos on the https://digibyte.io due to latest changes on the DigiByte blockchain.

1) Current "What is DigiByte?" video should be updated according to the latest changes. It must highlight the strengths of the blockchain such as MultiAlgo mining, Real-time difficulty adjustment and Odocrypt.

2) Current "Digital Currency" video should be updated to fix max TPS value and other a few things. It must highlight fees, speed and scalability features especially compared to the Bitcoin and Litecoin. Also Dandelion++ privacy protocol must be mentioned.

Apart from these two, other DigiByte videos can also be updated to be compatible with them.

Creators can host the videos on their own YouTube account to get traffic benefits. These videos will be served in modal windows on https://digibyte.io as they are now.
