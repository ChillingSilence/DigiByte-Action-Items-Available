# DigiAsset showcasing on mobile

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
There is currently no bounty available for this

### Is this being worked on?
Not yet

### Specifics
When a user has a large amount of DigiAssets, quick access to several of them either for use as a "showcase" (trophy cabinet style) or access to be able to prove ownership etc would be advantageous.

The way sending works at the moment this would likely require locally storing the AssetID in an array and showing those to the user, potentially allowing them to flag an asset and then being shown the screen and allowing them to (re)place the Asset in it's preferred location.

The implementation is open to suggestions / improvements
