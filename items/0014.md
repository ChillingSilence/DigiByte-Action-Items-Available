# Kotlin SDK

## Submitted by

## Bounty details

TBD

## Is this being worked on

No

## Specifics

The ubiquity of the Android platform makes it a prime candidate to have a first class Kotlin SDK that can be used to integrate support for DigiByte and DigiAssets into any modern Android application.  This SDK should be robustly documented so that code completion is fully supported in the Android Studio environment.  Additionally, the IntelliJ plugin will enable Android Developers to interact with the DigiByte Development Container directly within the IDE.
