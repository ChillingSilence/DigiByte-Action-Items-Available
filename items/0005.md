### Submitted by

### Bounty details

### Is this being worked on?
Yes by @OhGodAGirl

### Specifics
It's becoming incredibly clear over the last 18 months that the community is eager to bring back GPU mining to further improve the distribution and decentrlalization of mining.

This will also allow for home-based mining on GPU's by hobby-miners, as well as larger mining farms.

At present it looks as though replacing SHA256 makes the most rational sense, with RandomX replacing Qubit shortly thereafter.

Kristy-Leigh Minehan (@OhGodAGirl) has said she is open to doing this for the DigiByte blockchain.

This would go in to DigiByte Core 8.19.x
