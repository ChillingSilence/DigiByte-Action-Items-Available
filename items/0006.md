# Implement RandomX

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
A bounty is possible depending on the circumstances. If possible, this needs to be finalized before any promises are made and before work commences.

### Is this being worked on?
No

### Specifics
CPU-focused mining through RandomX has been proposed and largely accepted by the greater part of the community, ideally in tandem with ProgPoW.

This would be implemented in to 8.19.x ideally activating shortly thereafter, in order to minimize the amount of times end-users / entities have to upgrade (Say, a 11,520 block distance between the two being 2 days).
