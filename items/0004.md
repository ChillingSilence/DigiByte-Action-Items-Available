### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
There is currently no bounty available for this

### Is this being worked on?
This is being worked on by @SmartArray, @digicontributer & @JaredTate

### Specifics
There have been improvements in Bitcoin Core 0.19 which we should merge in to DigiByte 8.19 in order to pave the way for Schnorr Signatures

There will need to be care taken around the Dandelion++ implementation

The next version will be 8.19 as we will merge the Algo Swap in to this too, so extra care and additional testing will be needed there as well on testnet
