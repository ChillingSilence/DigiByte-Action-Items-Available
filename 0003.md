# Burn Assets on Android

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
There is currently no bounty available for this

### Is this being worked on?
No

### Specifics
Android currently supports sending / receiving but needs a better way to burn DigiAssets in line with iOS etc

Ideally we need users to confirm they want to burn without any possibility of it happening accidentally, such as requiring they enter part of their recovery phrase?

That part is open to implementation-specifics really and further feedback from the dev / users
