# Document notarization website

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
Private arrangement between @ChillingSilence and developer for completion of the project, funded by @ChillingSilence

### Is this being worked on?
Not yet

### Specifics
Ideally users should be able to hash a document and store that hash on the blockchain for further reference later on. This hashing should take place on the users local-PC rather than uploading the file to the server where corruption could occur. This hash is then shown to the user and subsequently stored on the blockchain, and the details of that provided to the user. This hash and details of it are stored in the websites database to make it easier to search later on.

Any user can hash a document on their local PC by visiting a specific part of this website (unrestricted), hash the document locally on their PC, and then ask this document notarization website if that hash is stored on the blockchain anywhere. Results are then shown to the user, with block-details / links to a blockchain explorer etc.

Storing this on the blockchain requires the user "credit" their account first, similar to CreateDigiAssets.com behavior.

Further UI details can be obtained from @ChillingSilence prior to commencement.
